High-level idea (what the system does)

A local early-warning node detects approaching elephants (using one or more sensing methods), classifies the event as “likely elephant”, then issues local alarms (sirens/LEDs), remote alerts (SMS/WhatsApp/MQTT push to a central dashboard), and optionally triggers deterrents (lights, loudspeakers) and geo-tagged logs.

2) Recommended architecture (modular)

Sensing layer (one or more):

Visual: ESP32-CAM or camera + TinyML classifier (detect elephant silhouette).

Acoustic: Microphone + TinyML model to detect elephant calls/infrasound patterns.

Proximity/size: Ultrasonic (HC-SR04), radar (RCWL-0516) or IR breakbeam to detect large moving object.

Passive IR (PIR): supplementary motion trigger.

Compute/comm:

ESP32 DevKit (or ESP32-CAM if using camera) for local processing and comms.

Alternative for heavier vision models: Raspberry Pi Zero/3/4 or Jetson Nano.

Communication:

Wi-Fi (if village has hotspot).

GSM module (SIM800L / SIM7000) for SMS/USSD if no Wi-Fi.

LoRa/LoRaWAN for long-range local mesh (to village center) — recommended for rural.

Power:

12V battery + solar panel + charge controller (for remote).

Actuation/alert:

Buzzer / siren, LED strobe, flashing light, pre-recorded speaker, SMS + MQTT/HTTP alert to central server or village leader’s phone.

Optional extras:

GPS (for location), RTC (for time-stamping), tamper detection.

3) Pros/cons of detection methods (short)

Camera (vision + TinyML)

Pros: high accuracy, useful verification (photo).

Cons: needs enough compute or cloud; false positives at night unless IR illumination; privacy concerns.

Best: ESP32-CAM with TinyML (Edge Impulse) for small models or Raspberry Pi for YOLO.

Acoustic (microphone + TinyML)

Pros: works at night; elephants vocalize (low-frequency).

Cons: needs good model and noise handling; infrasound below mic range might be missed unless specialized sensors.

Ultrasonic / PIR / Break-beam

Pros: cheap, low-power; immediate motion detection.

Cons: cannot reliably classify species (elephant vs cattle/human) — use as trigger for camera/recording.

Radar (Doppler)

Pros: robust in all weather, detects large moving objects.

Cons: costlier, tricky to integrate.

4) Minimal viable system (fast build)

Use this combo for an MVP:

ESP32 DevKit + HC-SR04 ultrasonic + PIR + SIM800L GSM
Flow: PIR/HC-SR04 detects large motion ⇒ ESP32 wakes camera (optional) or directly sends SMS & triggers local siren. Over time replace rule-based alerts with TinyML.

5) Bill of Materials (BOM) — essentials

ESP32 DevKit (or ESP32-CAM if using camera) — 1

HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor — 1 (or radar sensor)

PIR motion sensor — 1

SIM800L GSM module (with SIM card + small LiPo battery) or LoRa module — 1

Buzzer / 12V siren / 5V speaker — 1

Relay or MOSFET driver (to drive siren/12V devices)

Solar panel + charge controller + battery (for remote)

Enclosure (weatherproof), mounting poles

Wires, connectors, resistors, level shifter for SIM800L if needed

6) Wiring & interfacing notes (key points)

SIM800L needs stable 4V supply and high surge current — use a LiPo + regulator or a 4V DC supply; do not power from ESP32 5V pin.

HC-SR04 trig/echo use 5V tolerant pins; if using 3.3V ESP32, put a voltage divider on the echo line to protect ESP32.

ESP32-CAM needs separate FTDI 5V programmer and care with flashing pins.

Put electronics in a ventilated, waterproof enclosure; use an external microphone with wind shield for acoustic sensors.

7) Software design & detection flow

Sleep/low-power monitoring (deep-sleep with periodic wake or wake on PIR interrupt).

On trigger (PIR or ultrasonic threshold):
a. Start camera capture (optional) and/or record short audio snippet.
b. Run lightweight classifier (if available) or apply heuristic (size from ultrasonic + time of day + motion).
c. If classified as elephant (or high confidence): issue alarms and send remote alert (SMS/MQTT).

Log event (timestamp, sensor data, optional photo/GPS) to SD card and/or server.

Resume low-power state or monitoring.

8) Example ESP32 code — ultrasonic + GSM + buzzer

This is a simple working baseline: ultrasonic triggers a local siren and sends an SMS via SIM800L. (It assumes hardware wiring described in comments and a working SIM card.) Use Arduino core for ESP32.
